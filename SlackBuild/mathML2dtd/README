mathML2dtd is a group of shell scripts, SGML catalog
and required files used for creating a removable 
SlackBuild package for W3 MathML2 DTD.

After the installation of W3 MahML2 DTD the new catalog 
file catalog.new has to be moved to the /etc/xml/catalog 
which was installed by the 'linuxdoc-tools' package located 
under 'slackware/ap'.

If /etc/xml/catalog.new is present it has to be manually 
moved by the user to /etc/xml/catalog for finalizing 
installation.

After the uninstallation of the 'mathML2dtd' package
DON'T forget to reinstall 'linuxdoc-tools' package for 
resetting the /etc/xml/docbook to its original state.
