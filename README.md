## Roadmap

Essentially I've created this repo to solve my problem at the first place and
I've to admit I really have no idea in the beginning but with time I've learned
lots of stuff from the guys and the gals like myself who has tried to solve their
problems and decided to share their findings with other individuals who might
face similar problems. Remembering all of them individually at this point is
a bit hard for me so I've created this repo to show my graditude.

The next thing for this repo might be encouriging users of other distros for creation
of a similar packages for their preferred distros

and

entering the listed packages of [slackbuilds dot org](https://slackbuilds.org).

Additional ideas related with the future are welcomed.
